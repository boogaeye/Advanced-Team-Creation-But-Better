## Advanced Team Creation

This is a plugin and maybe a framework for some plugins to create custom teams for SCPSL

**Compatability**
--
- Respawn Timer
- AudioPlayer

**NOT COMPATABLE**
--
- RemoteKeycard(if using custom keycards)
- Any Team Plugin that does not use ATC API(Will probably not support them either)
